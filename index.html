				<h2>How much does it cost to open a restaurant in Toronto?</h2>
				<article>
					<p>This is part two in our How To Open a Restaurant, a series on the realities of opening your own restaurant in a city like Toronto. Last time we explored what it takes to develop a concept. This time, it’s about funding your dream restaurant.

						Being good in the kitchen or willing to work weekends and holidays isn’t enough to open a restaurant. You need lots of money.
						
						“You can have the concept right, the planning of staff to customer ratios, food costs planned out, everything perfect. But if you do not have deep enough pockets you’ll never be able to realize your idea,” says Pete Zoutis, who co-owns the Middle Eastern-inspired Rikkochez restaurant on the Danforth. “Funding is your number one priority.”
						
						There’s no exact price to opening a 30-seat restaurant, but $250,000 is a good estimate, he says. Unless that’s already in the bank, funding options have to be explored. Some sell existing property, others take out a line of credit, turn to crowdfunding, make friends with a financial backer or a combination of those things. Of course, most people think of a bank when it comes to securing a loan, but what does it take to convince bankers to give thousands of dollars to someone who has never run a restaurant?</p>

							About four years ago, Zoutis and his wife, chef Chrystallo Nicholas, wanted to open a cozy, 30-seat neighbourhood spot that showcased Nicholas’ Cypriot cooking, an under-represented cuisine in the city’s dining scene. Among her specialties: a deliciously spiced Cypriot pork sausage called sheftalia served with crispy falafel containing a pleasant acidic zing on a bed of tabbouleh, pita and chunky hummus. There’s also a summery, vegan-friendly bowl called louvi, consisting of black-eyed peas, roasted squash and vegetables, simply tossed with olive oil and lemon juice.

							The two did their homework before signing a lease: Zoutis enlisted his old colleagues from his previous career in market research and brand consulting to conduct a phone survey of a thousand Toronto residents. They were asked about their dining habits, thoughts on restaurant design and menu items, typical market research questions for a new food venture.

							The couple settled on a spot just across from Chester subway station on the Danforth, a relatively affordable neighbourhood compared to the west-end, and the area also tested well with respondents as a dining destination. The space was briefly a cannabis paraphernalia shop and before that, the Silk Road restaurant, once featured on the renovation show Restaurant Makeover. Monthly rent including taxes, maintenance and insurance was $4,500. The ventilation system and kitchen were intact, saving the couple tens of thousands of dollars in equipment. The bathrooms, floors and walls needed to be redone, however, a counter needed to be built for the kitchen pass, and mould needed to be removed from the bathroom. Altogether, Zoutis estimated he’d need $250,000 to cover the initial costs as well as the first few months of opening where business might be slow and extra money may be needed to cover bills and wages.

							The $50,000 he had in the bank wasn’t enough, but Zoutis did own a condo in the city in addition to a house they just put a down payment on. He sold the condo for about $330,000 and took a line of credit on his house for just over $100,000 in case of an emergency. Combined with the $50,000 he already had, it was enough for the couple to open their restaurant.

							But having property to sell isn’t a viable fundraising option for everyone.

							Enterprise Toronto is a program from the city of Toronto that helps small businesses, including restaurants, get off the ground through in-person consultations or through its online resources. On its site, EnterpriseToronto.Desk.Com, are webinars on starting a business as well as listings for in-person seminars on topics such as funding, legal advice and marketing for small businesses (the seminars range from being free to costing $10 or $25). Zoutis himself attended a few of the seminars and did some free one-one-counselling sessions, saying they gave him a better idea of what he and his wife were getting into.

							Enterprise Toronto itself can’t fund a business, but its site does list a few funding options such as locally-based angel investors (a group of affluent individuals that fund startups in exchange for a stake in the company), the government’s Canada Small Business Financing Program and microloans (loans that are generally less than $50,000).

							Crowdfunding through sites such as GoFundMe and Indiegogo can also be an option for restaurants, says Chris Rickett, manager of Toronto’s economic development and culture division. This is because traditional funding resources such as banks are hesitant to fund an independently owned restaurant, especially from inexperienced owners, he says. Zoutis looked into grant programs, but found out that many of them gave out $5,000 here and $10,000 there, which he says is a good chunk of money for people wanting to develop a food product, but it’s not enough to take over the lease of a restaurant.

							The early adapters of crowdfunding did find success when it was still considered a novel way of opening a restaurant and gained attention in the news. In fall 2015, chef Dave Mottershall opened Loka Snacks on Queen Street West after raising $41,000 from diners who were promised meals and swag in exchange for their donation. In 2014, Matthew Kershaw and Erin Dunham opened The Mule in Hamilton after raising more than $100,000 on Indiegogo.

							Now, the crowdfunding scene is a lot more saturated. On GoFundMe, there’s a page asking for $160,000 to help a family pay bills and reopen their Indian restaurant in Bloordale after it suffered extensive water damage from a neighbouring fire (there have been zero donations since the page was created in January). Another page is asking for $5,000 to start a Dominican food truck, raised $200 since February 2018. A page for longstanding diner Detroit Eatery, which was destroyed in a fire in January, did however raise more than $26,000 of their $30,000 goal (plus another $800 in a second GoFundMe page) after its closure made headlines across the city.

							If there’s no property to sell or biters on GoFundMe, what are the chances that a bank would give a loan for a type of business that has a notoriously high failure rate?
						</p>

						<p>
							The Canada Small Business Financing Program is a loan sponsored by the government and given out by banks. Up to $1 million can be given out, with $350,000 of it meant for the purchase of equipment such as appliances, fixtures and furniture as well as renovations. According to Joseph Pisani, director of franchise finance at the Bank of Montreal, the average restaurateurs get from this loan is $300,000.

							But the odds of seeing any money are better if the proposed restaurant is a franchise or chain, says Pisani. This is because a chain, be it a Tim Hortons or McDonald’s, comes equipped with food suppliers, operation manuals and a marketing strategy from the franchisor, for example. Brand recognition from the public will mean the restaurant will have a built-in customer base, and the bank would already have a good idea of how the business operates.

							The first thing a bank would look at is the applicant’s credit history. If it’s good, the bank would then look at how much money the restaurateur has upfront, independently or from investors (ideally, at least half of the restaurant’s start-up costs would be covered). If it’s an independent restaurant, a very comprehensive business plan is required indicating location, projected profits, how many meals need to be sold in a month to cover all the bills, and what’s the plan if there’s no sales in the first month.

							“Many people walk away at this point,” Pisani says. “There are people that are really gung-ho and think they can change the history of the culinary scene but there’s a very, very high failure rate in the restaurant industry. People don’t realize that just because you came from culinary school or worked at the top restaurant means you can run a restaurant. When I ask what your experience is, it better be more than just cooking.”

						<p>
							As a result Pisani says most banks tend to shy away from independent restaurants. Instead, he recommends first-time restaurateurs find a partner who can navigate the business or culinary side of things (and help contribute to the costs). If the partner is an established restaurateur, then there’s a greater chance of getting a loan from the bank, as they have a proven track record. It’s a trend he says he’s been seeing among independent restaurants in recent years: more owners teaming up to combine capital and experience rather than applying for bank loans.

							But just because enough funding was raised to open a restaurant, having the money to keep it open in the first months is also essential. Zoutis and Nicholas at Rikkochez came across some unexpected expenses after opening, such as a broken air conditioner ($3,000), fixing the kitchen exhaust system ($2,000) and food waste while they were still figuring out how many customers to expect on a typical night.

							For Rikkochez restaurant to break even, sales need to be around $25,000 per month. During the summer, it’s pretty close to that figure but during the winter, it’s closer to $15,000 a month.

							“I remember in the first year I had to infuse capital into this business, about $5,000 to $10,000 a month to keep the bills paid every month,” he says. “I’m operating at a loss right now but there’s good momentum as it gets warmer and we get repeat customers. It’ll take a couple of years to be profitable and build up a clientele but when it’s your money and you’ve gone through the blood, sweat and tears to open, it becomes the focal point of all your energy. You do what you need to do to make it work.”
